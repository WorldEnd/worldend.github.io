## Contributing
If you want to contribute to the formatting or revise the text, contribute to our [other repository](https://github.com/WorldEnd/worldend-formatting). We use a GitHub Action to download the latest release from that repository and display it on the website, so any changes to the text or formatting need to be made there.
